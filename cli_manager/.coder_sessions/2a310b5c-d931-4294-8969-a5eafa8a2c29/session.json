      "response": " I can help you with that! In Go, to do something is quite similar to in C or other languages, but with added benefits such as strong typing and efficient memory management. \n\nHere's a basic example of how to print \"Hello World\" using the `fmt` package in Go:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello, world!\")\n}\n```\n\nYou can find the source code and documentation for other functions [here](http://golang.org/pkg/).
